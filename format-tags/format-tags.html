	<p>Come, let us build us a tower whose top may reach<sup>unto <sup>the <sup>stars!</sup></sup></sup><br>
		And on top of the tower we will write the words: <b>Great</b> is the world and its<strong> Creator!</strong> And great is <strong>Man!</strong> ...but the minds that had conceived the <cite>Tower of Babel</cite> could <em>not</em> build it. The task was too great. So they hired hands for <i>wages</i>. But the <del>people's</del>hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of the brain that<sub>had <sub>conceived <sub>it.</sub></sub></sub><br>
		<blockquote>
			BABEL!
			BABEL!
			BABEL!			
		</blockquote>
		One man's hymns of praise became other men's curses. People spoke the same language, but could not understand each other..."HEAD and HANDS need a <em>mediator</em>."<br>
