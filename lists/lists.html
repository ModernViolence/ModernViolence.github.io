		<li>Why, Mr. Anderson, why?</li>
		<li>Why, why do you do it?</li>
		<li>Why, why get up?</li>
		<li>Why keep fighting?</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival?</li>
		<li>Can you tell me what it is, do you even know?</li> 
		<ul>
			<li>Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace — could it be for love?</li>
		</ul> 
		<li>Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose.</li>
			<li> And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself.</li>
		</ul> 
		<li>Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.</li><li>You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now!</li>
		<li>You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why, why do you persist?</li>
	</ul>
